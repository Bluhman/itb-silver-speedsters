# Into The Breach Mod - Silver Speedsters squad
This mod adds a custom squad that emphasizes high speed, kinetic attacks, and repositioning. Note this is my first mod I've made for this game, so expect "Ploish".

## The Squad:
![Sprint Mech](https://github.com/Bluhman/itb-silver-speedsters/blob/master/img/units/player/mech_sprint.png?raw=true)**Sprint Mech** (Prime)  
Equipped with the **Pummeling Sprint** weapon, allowing it to charge in a straight line to deal damage that scales with the distance covered by the charge.

![Racing Mech](https://github.com/Bluhman/itb-silver-speedsters/blob/master/img/units/player/mech_racing.png?raw=true)**Racing Mech** (Brute)  
Comes equipped with **Aries Engines**, a variant of the default Hermes Engine that can deal damage to the tile  at the end of the dash, in exchange for limited range.  
It also comes equipped with **Crash Dampeners**, a passive which auto-repairs any mech damage taken from collisions.

![Track Mech](https://github.com/Bluhman/itb-silver-speedsters/blob/master/img/units/player/mech_track.png?raw=true)**Track Mech** (Science)  
The Track Mech is a *Flying* mech that comes equipped with **Accelerator Tracks**, deployable units with a set direction that allow them to **Accelerate** a target
over themselves as far as possible, colliding with any obstruction, or to **Ramp** them to a set position, destroying the track in the process.

## Installation
1. This mod, and most like it, requires [kartoFlane's ITB Mod Loader](https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader) to run. Install this first if you haven't already.
2. Because this is still very early in development, you can click on the green **Code** dropdown in the upper-right to **Download Zip**. The contents of this repository
represents what essentially goes into the mod directory.
3. Extract the zip into the `mods` directory inside the ITB install directory, and run the game!
